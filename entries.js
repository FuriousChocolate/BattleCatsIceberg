A site with info about all sorts of cats, stages, enemies, and more!</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://battle-cats.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Cats_Wiki\">The battle cats wiki</a>, a website for everything you could want to know about The Battle Cats. Often known for having info that isn't 100% trustable or reliable, especially for strategies and non-factual information, but still an overall very useful resource for people looking to know more about The Battle Cats.</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\" https://thanksfeanor.pythonanywhere.com/UDP\">The Uber description project (UDP)</a> is a website created by ThanksFëanor to document the usefulness of all Ubers and what scenarios they might work best in, if at all. It has a lot of work put into it and a lot of people spent a lot of time writing info for it, so I recommend you check it out!</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://thanksfeanor.pythonanywhere.com/black-catculator\">The Black Calculator</a> is a website (technically just a really advanced google spreadsheet) that is designed so that a Battle Cats player would be able to create a copy of it and input all of their unit, treasure, and progress info into it so that they wouldn't have to constantly post screenshots of their ubers or other things when asking for help. I haven't looked into it too much so it probably has a lot more features than what I just described, and it is an overall very useful tool.</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://alcantha.github.io/cat_combo_viewer/\">The Catcombo Viewer</a> Pretty self explanatory.

I <b>strongly</b> discourage anyone from using this site as I beleive it ruins the fun of the game, but I had to leave it in this list because I valued an ultimate comprehensive iceberg above all else.</li></ul>",
